Allows you to add an expiration date (minute) to posts which you can configure to either delete the post or change it to a draft.

== Description ==

The Post Expirator plugin allows the user to set expiration dates for both posts and pages.  There is a configuration option page in the plugins 
area that will allow you to seperataly control whether or not posts/pages are wither deleted or changed to draft status.

The plugin hooks into the wp cron processes and runs every hour.

The expiration date can be displayed within the actual post by using the [postexpirator] tag.  The format attribute will override the plugin 
default display format.  See the [PHP Date Function](http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php) for valid date/time format options.
